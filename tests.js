//Unit Tests
//A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.
//1.

//Expect multiplication(5, 0) to be equal to 0.

//A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.
//expect ([1,2,3,4,5] [4,2,6,7,1,3,9,0]) to return ([1,3,5,7,9])
//expect string input to return error
//expect multiples of the same number to return the number once
//expect negative numbers to be returned as well
//expect more than two arrays to return error
//expect one array to be returned on its own
